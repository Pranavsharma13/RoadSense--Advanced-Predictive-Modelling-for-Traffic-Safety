**RoadSense: Advanced Predictive Modeling for Traffic Safety**  

The RoadSense project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict the occurrence and severity of traffic accidents using the US-Accidents dataset, which contains over 2.25 million records. The project employs models like Random Forest, LSTM, CNNs, and Prophet to analyze key factors such as weather, traffic conditions, and time of day. The project utilized Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Tableau for data processing, feature engineering, and visualization. With a focus on actionable insights for traffic safety, the application was deployed using Streamlit, providing real-time predictive capabilities. In-depth feature engineering, including dimensionality reduction with PCA and handling class imbalance using SMOTE, resulted in the model achieving 86% accuracy, with a strong emphasis on interpretability to drive better policy and safety decisions.
