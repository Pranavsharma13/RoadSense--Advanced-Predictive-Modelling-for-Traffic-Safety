**RoadSense: Advanced Predictive Modeling for Traffic Safety**  
Developed and deployed a predective Streamlit-based application using machine and deep learning models, including Random Forest, LSTM, and Prophet, achieving 86% accuracy in predicting traffic accident severity. Leveraged the US-Accidents dataset (2.25M records) for insights into spatiotemporal patterns, weather impacts, and traffic conditions. The project utilized Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Tableau for data processing, feature engineering, and visualization, providing actionable insights to enhance road safety and inform policy decisions.
